**Two identical conducting balls having positive charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are separated by a centre to centre distance r. If they are made to touch each other and then separated to the same distance, the force between them will be**

```markdown
Initial force: F₁ = k (q₁ q₂) / r²

When the two identical conducting balls touch each other, charge redistributes equally because they are identical conductors.
Total charge = q₁ + q₂
Charge on each after contact = (q₁ + q₂) / 2

After separation to the same distance r, the new force is:
F₂ = k [((q₁+q₂)/2) × ((q₁+q₂)/2)] / r²
F₂ = k (q₁+q₂)² / (4r²)

Now compare F₂ with F₁:
F₂ / F₁ = [ (q₁+q₂)² / 4 ] / (q₁ q₂) = (q₁² + 2q₁q₂ + q₂²) / (4q₁q₂)

By AM ≥ GM inequality, (q₁² + q₂²) ≥ 2q₁q₂, so:
(q₁² + 2q₁q₂ + q₂²) ≥ 4q₁q₂
Thus, F₂ / F₁ ≥ 1

Therefore, the force after touching is **more than before** (except when q₁ = q₂, in which case it remains the same; but since the options don't include "same or more", and the question implies q₁ ≠ q₂, the correct choice is "more than before").

Correct answer: **more than before**
